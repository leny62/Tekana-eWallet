Context:

- Imagine you are appointed to lead  team of engineers to revamp a legacy application that is used worldwide by customers to transfer money
- For the sake of this test, the application is called "Tekana-eWallet"
- The tech team is composed of back-ends, front ends, UI, UX designers and product owner as well as a Scrum Master. The business team is also there to help with the requirements as a subject matter experts.




Mission:

Your mission is to rebuild from scratch a back-end solution for a legacy platform that serves 1 million customers around the world.

We would like to re-design the whole technology stack with a top-notch back-end stack.



This is what is required to deliver:
      - Strategy: Please explain step by step using bullet points your strategy you would use to get the job done:
           . Your strategy or plan needs to show what needs to happen from day 1 until the go-live of the pilot system.
           . This strategy must display your great understanding of how you understand engineering practices, you engage with Business units(departments), you use proper terms as well as how you understand the front-end requirements to design amazing code source solutions

   - Code source: Write the back-end solution with a minimum feature that showcases how you would design from the code source.
        * These are the required features to be built:
               1. create, Read customers (Registration)
               2. Create and read the wallets of customers
               3. create and read transactions




Evaluation Criteria's:

For the Programming language, we prefer Nest-JS or Spring Boot stack if possible but if you are not familiar with it, please use your own framework if it is a modern stack.

These are the criteria we will be using to evaluate:
  1. How the code is structured
  2. Code simplicity, readability, maintainability, and how easy it is to test
  3. Database design, and readiness for high performance. (Indexing, etc) in case there is a need.
  4. How APIs are documented and designed with best practices
  5. Creativity/Innovation



Take note:

1. The strategy is expected to be found in the README file of the source code
2. The source code needs to be pushed to Git and accessible to recruiters until end of January
3. Your code. should be ready to be run with no extra configuration.
4. In case you think that there is another source code where you have done amazing stuff that you have built and that can draw a better picture of your coding skills then you are allowed to submit it in the place of the one mentioned in the exercise
